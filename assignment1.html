<h1> Haw Par Villa </h1>

<p> <font size="3" face="verdana" color="black"> Haw Par Villa - formerly known as the Tiger Balm Garden - is an 8.5-hectar Asian cultural park, the last of its kind in the world. Built in 1937, Singapore's largest outdoor art gallery is the brainchild of Aw Boon Haw, the millionaire philanthropist and marketing extraordinaire who gifted the world Tiger Balm. The eclectic part is a treasure trove of Asian culture, history, philosophy and religion - quirky yet enlightening, at the same time. Since 2015, it is managed by Journeys Pte Ltd, an award-winning heritage specialist passionate in preserving and bringing the heritage gem to greater heights.</p>

<h2> <font size="5" face="verdana" color="black"> Park Map </h2>
<p> <font size="3" face="verdana" color="black"> Ascend, dear wanderers, on the signature red brick road, through the majestic entrance archway. Look out for Chinese classics such as Journey to the West and the Eight Immortals. Tigers, leopards and dragons lurk in corners. Rolling hills and caves evoke contemplation and reflection. Elsewhere in the park, animals of all shapes and sizes beckon: goats, pandas, rabbits, gorillas, giant lobsters, even a crab-lady, the list goes on. Here - use this map - it will show you the way around the park. Enter the park via the main gate close to the Haw Par Villa MRT Station.</p>
